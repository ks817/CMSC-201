#   all first generation Pokemon that have a certain move
#   (entered in by the user) through use of a dictionary.

# Input:          ifp;     a file pointer to the text file containing the
#                          pokemon and their four different moves
# Output:         pokeDex; dictionary of pokemon : move list
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
